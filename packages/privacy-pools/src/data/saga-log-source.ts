 * events only hydrates state if its root matches the pool's on-chain currentRoot
 * (see saga-reconstruction.test.ts), so a dishonest or stale saga is caught.
 * Entrypoint events (deposits, root updates, pool registrations) have no such
 * on-chain checkpoint to replay against, so consuming them from saga trades that
 * verifiability for a degree of trust in the saga source. The RPC tail past
 * saga's head still comes from the authoritative chain.

 * {@link createSagaDataService}) to hydrate pool state without a full RPC crawl.
